# projectsqlserver
Creating a database and inserting data using SQL SERVER.


This was a class project where I had to create a Database and insert some data and manipulate them.
Also it contains a word document where there are a tutorial that explain and shows the code and results that
it should present.

All code and documents are in text files, if you need to execute them just use your SQL Server to insert the code.
